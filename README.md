## Smooth Curve3D / 2D

[smooth_curve](smooth_curve) contains a Godot 4 project that contains
the [SmoothCurve](smooth_curve/smooth_curve.gd) class that generates a
smooth Curve3D from a set of points. The curve will pass through all
specified points and will be continuous at the first and second
derivative at each of those points. An example @tool script that runs
in the editor can be found in
[smooth_curve_test.gd](smooth_curve/smooth_curve_test.gd).
